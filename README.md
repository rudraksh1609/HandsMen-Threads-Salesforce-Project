# HandsMen Threads: Elevating the Art of Sophistication in Men's Fashion  

This repository contains my Salesforce project **HandsMen Threads**, where I implemented automation flows and a robust data model to improve customer engagement, operational efficiency, and overall business management in the fashion industry.

## Project Overview  

HandsMen Threads is a dynamic organization in the fashion industry. With this Salesforce project, the aim was to:  

- Build a robust data model to store all business-critical data.  
- Ensure data integrity directly from the UI, safeguarding accuracy and consistency.  
- Automate critical customer engagement processes like order confirmations, loyalty programs, and stock alerts.  

This project enhances customer relations while also making internal operations more efficient and reliable.

## Implemented Use Cases  

### 1. Automated Order Confirmations  
Customers receive a confirmation email immediately after placing an order.
